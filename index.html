<div "Introduction">
  <p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">
  Therapeutic Services is based in South East London as a collective of counsellors
  and  psychotherapists with many years of experience offering means tested private
  treatment to young people and adults.
  <br><br>
  Our therapists hold professional registration or accreditation with the BACP and
  BABCP umbrella regulatory bodies. Each therapist is fully insured and have a minimum
  of 2 years of post qualification experience working within the community, for employment
  support organisations, and for statutory services such as the NHS.
  <br><br>
  Individually we offer a variety of different approaches informed by our training and
  areas of specialism including Integrative counselling, Existential, CBT, Family and
  relationship psychotherapy. Collectively we have a shared commitment to working collaboratively
  within a therapeutic relationship that is client led and built on trust. We offer telephone and
  online services for those who cannot physically access our premises.
  <br><br>
  If you are looking for some support of this kind please browse through our profiles.
  We are happy to offer a free 30 minute telephone consultation to help you decide if therapy
  is the right step for you, and to help you find a therapist to meet your needs.
